Let's walk through how the application starts, which methods are called, and which objects are created in what sequence:

Application Startup:

The application starts when the main method in the MyMainApp class is invoked.
Inside the main method, Quarkus.run(args) is called, which bootstraps the Quarkus runtime and starts the application.
Quarkus Initialization:

Quarkus initializes various components and dependencies required for the application to run.
This includes setting up the runtime environment, dependency injection, and scanning for application components like REST endpoints, services, and entities.
Dependency Injection:

During initialization, Quarkus injects dependencies into managed beans and components, such as the FilmService and FilmController.
In your case, the FilmService is injected with a Film object, likely provided by Quarkus via Panache.
Service Initialization:

When the FilmService is constructed, it receives a Film object, possibly injected by Quarkus.
The FilmService constructor initializes its dependencies and sets up the necessary resources for interacting with the database.
REST Endpoint Initialization:

Similarly, when the FilmController is initialized, it receives an injected FilmService instance.
The FilmController sets up REST endpoints and defines the logic to handle incoming HTTP requests related to films.
Handling HTTP Requests:

When an HTTP request is received by the application, it is routed to the appropriate endpoint method in the FilmController based on the request URL and HTTP method.
For example, a GET request to /film/{filmId} would be handled by the getFilm method in the FilmController.
Method Invocation:

Upon receiving an HTTP request, the corresponding method in the FilmController is invoked.
Inside the method, business logic is executed, which may involve calling methods from the injected FilmService to interact with the database or perform other operations.
Database Interaction:

When the FilmService methods are called, they interact with the database using Panache methods like findById, find, update, etc.
These database operations are asynchronous and non-blocking, allowing the application to remain responsive.
Response Generation:

After executing the necessary logic, the controller methods generate a response, which typically includes data retrieved from the database or a message indicating the outcome of the operation.
The response is then sent back to the client that made the HTTP request.
Application Shutdown:

When the application is shut down, cleanup tasks may be performed, such as closing database connections or releasing resources.
This sequence of steps outlines how your Quarkus application starts, handles HTTP requests, interacts with the database, and generates responses. Each step plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the application.
