The API call/request flow in the provided code involves several components and follows a structured pattern typical in Java-based web applications using JAX-RS (Jakarta RESTful Web Services) and CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how a request flows through the system:

Request Flow Explanation
Client Request:

A client sends an HTTP request to one of the defined endpoints in FilmController.
JAX-RS Endpoint Mapping:

JAX-RS annotations (@Path, @GET, @PUT, etc.) in FilmController map the incoming request URI to specific methods.
Controller Layer (FilmController):

The request is handled by methods in FilmController, which is responsible for accepting HTTP requests and invoking appropriate business logic.
Dependency Injection (CDI):

FilmController injects various use case interfaces (IGetFilmById, IGetFilmsStartingWith, etc.) defined in the org.ashimroy.app.application.usecases package.
Use Case Layer (IGetFilmById, IGetFilmsStartingWith, etc.):

Use case interfaces are implemented by classes like GetFilmById, GetFilmsStartingWith, etc., which reside in the org.ashimroy.app.application.usecases package.
Each use case interacts with the FilmRepository (from org.ashimroy.app.domain.repository) to retrieve or update data.
Repository Layer (FilmRepository):

The FilmRepository, defined in org.ashimroy.app.domain.repository, provides methods (findFilmById, findByTitleStartingWithAndLengthGreaterThan, etc.) to interact with the database or data source (FilmEntity in org.ashimroy.app.infrastructure.repository).
Entity and Persistence Layer (FilmEntity, FilmRepositoryImpl):

FilmEntity, located in org.ashimroy.app.infrastructure.repository, represents the persistent entity mapped to the database table (film). It uses JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, etc.) for mapping.
FilmRepositoryImpl or similar classes provide implementations for methods defined in FilmRepository, utilizing JPA for database operations.
Response Construction:

After retrieving data from the repository, the use case constructs a response (Uni<Response> in the controller methods).
Responses can be successful (Response.ok(...).build()) or indicate errors (Response.status(...).build()).

Exception Handling:

Use cases may handle exceptions like NotFoundException to recover from errors and return appropriate HTTP responses.
Classes Involved
Controller Layer: FilmController
Use Case Layer Interfaces: IGetFilmById, IGetFilmsStartingWith, etc.
Use Case Layer Implementations: GetFilmById, GetFilmsStartingWith, etc.
Domain Entities: Film (in org.ashimroy.app.domain.entity) and FilmEntity (in org.ashimroy.app.infrastructure.repository)
Repositories: FilmRepository (in org.ashimroy.app.domain.repository) and its implementations.
Summary
The flow starts from the client request, passes through the JAX-RS endpoints, utilizes CDI for dependency injection into the controller, invokes use case methods that interact with the repository layer, retrieves data from FilmEntity mapped to the database, and constructs an HTTP response back to the client. This structured approach separates concerns and ensures a clear flow from HTTP request to database interaction and response generation.
