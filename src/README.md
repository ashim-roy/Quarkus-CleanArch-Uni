The project appears to be a Java application for managing films, with a RESTful API implemented using Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS). Here's a summary of the project:


A Java application using Quarkus and Hibernate ORM with Panache for data persistence. The application is  interacting with a database, specifically a table named "film" in the "sakila" schema.

The Film class is an entity class representing the "film" table in the database. It extends PanacheEntity, which is a convenience class provided by Quarkus that comes with an auto-generated ID field.

The Film entity has at least two fields: title and description. The title field is marked as non-nullable, meaning every film must have a title. The description field does not have this restriction.

Without more information, it's hard to provide a more detailed summary. However, given the sakila schema, it's possible that this application is a part of a movie rental service, as "sakila" is a well-known MySQL sample database that represents a DVD rental store.


Purpose: The project aims to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for films through a RESTful API.

Technologies Used:

Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS): For creating RESTful endpoints.
SmallRye Mutiny: For handling asynchronous operations and promises.
Panache: For simplifying database operations by directly using the entity class.
Components:

FilmController: Defines RESTful endpoints for interacting with films, such as retrieving films by ID, fetching paged films, updating rental rates, etc.
FilmService: Provides methods for performing operations on films, such as fetching films from the database, updating rental rates, etc.
Endpoints:

GET /helloAshim: A test endpoint to check if the service is running.
GET /film/{filmId}: Retrieves a film by its ID.
GET /pagedFilms/{page}/{minLength}: Retrieves a page of films with a minimum length.
GET /actors/{startsWith}/{minLength}: Retrieves films with titles starting with a given string and minimum length.
PUT /update/{minLength}/{rentalRate}: Updates the rental rate of films with lengths greater than a given minimum length.
Error Handling:

Proper error handling is implemented, such as returning error messages for invalid input or when films are not found.
Summary:

The project provides a robust backend for managing films through a RESTful API.
It leverages modern Java frameworks and libraries for efficient and asynchronous processing.
The codebase is well-structured and follows best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Overall, the project serves as a solid foundation for building a film management system with capabilities for CRUD operations and error handling via RESTful endpoints.
