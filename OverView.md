The provided files indicate a Quarkus-based application with RESTful services for interacting with a database containing information about films. Here's an overview of how the application works:

Overview of the Application
Build Configuration (POM.xml):

Project Dependencies: The application uses Quarkus, a Java framework tailored for building microservices and serverless applications. Dependencies include Quarkus components for RESTEasy, Hibernate ORM with Panache, JDBC for MySQL, Swagger UI, JPAStreamer for streaming JPA entities, and testing frameworks.
Plugins: Maven plugins are used for compiling, packaging, and running tests. The Quarkus Maven plugin is configured for building the application and generating code.
Docker Configuration:

Dockerfile: Defines the image for running the Quarkus application. The base image is OpenJDK 11, and the Quarkus application is copied into the container.
docker-compose.yml: Defines the services for the application:
db: A MySQL database service with a preloaded sakila database.
app: The Quarkus application service that depends on the database service.
Application Code:

Controller (FilmController): Provides endpoints to interact with the film database.
/helloAshim: A simple endpoint to test the service.
/film/{filmId}: Fetches a film by its ID.
/pagedFilms/{page}/{minLength}: Fetches a paginated list of films with a length greater than a specified minimum.
/actors/{startsWith}/{minLength}: Fetches films with titles starting with a specified string and a length greater than a specified minimum.
/update/{minLength}/{rentalRate}: Updates the rental rate for films with a length greater than a specified minimum.

Repository (FilmRepository): Interacts with the database using JPAStreamer.
getFilm(short filmId): Retrieves a film by its ID.
getFilms(short minLength): Retrieves films with a length greater than the specified minimum.
paged(long page, short minLength): Retrieves a paginated list of films.
actors(String startsWith, short minLength): Retrieves films with titles starting with the specified string and a length greater than the specified minimum.
updateRentalRate(short minLength, Float rentalRate): Updates the rental rate for films with a length greater than the specified minimum.
Model (Film): Represents the film entity in the database with fields like filmId, title, description, languageId, rentalDuration, rentalRate, length, etc. It uses JPA annotations for mapping to the database table.
How It Works
Build and Deployment:

The application is built using Maven. The quarkus-maven-plugin handles the compilation, packaging, and running of the application.
The Dockerfile is used to create a container image of the Quarkus application. The docker-compose file sets up the necessary services (application and database).
Running the Application:

Start the application using Docker Compose, which will start both the MySQL database and the Quarkus application.
The application runs on port 8080 inside the container, and is exposed on port 8081 on the host machine.
Interacting with the Application:

Use the provided RESTful endpoints to interact with the sakila database:
Test the service with /helloAshim.
Retrieve film details with /film/{filmId}.
Get a paginated list of films with /pagedFilms/{page}/{minLength}.
Fetch films with titles starting with a specific string and a certain length with /actors/{startsWith}/{minLength}.
Update rental rates for films using /update/{minLength}/{rentalRate}.
Swagger UI:

The application includes Swagger UI for API documentation, allowing you to explore and test the endpoints through a web interface.
Summary
This Quarkus application is set up to interact with a MySQL database containing film data, providing various endpoints for querying and updating film records. It leverages Quarkus features for efficient development and deployment, using Docker for containerization and Maven for build automation.
